              1. Scope These Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale ("Terms")
              shall govern the sale by The Fruit Box Ltd. (“The Fruit Box”) of
              all goods and/or services (collectively, the “Services”) as well
              as all subsequent transactions between The Fruit Box and the
              purchaser ("Purchaser"). The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
              that these Terms shall constitute part of any final contract of
              sale created by the completion of an Order Form either online or
              in person ("Sales Agreement") that may be entered into between
              Purchaser and The Fruit Box. In the event of any inconsistency
              between the terms and conditions contained in any other document
              and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail unless otherwise agreed
              upon in writing by The Fruit Box or its duly authorized
              representative. The Fruit Box shall not be bound by any terms and
              conditions affixed to Purchaser's order form or other procurement
              documents that are in addition to or inconsistent with these
              Terms. Neither commencement of performance nor delivery by The
              Fruit Box shall be deemed or constituted as acceptance of
              Purchaser's additional or conflicting terms and conditions. Terms
              are subject to change at The Fruit Box's sole discretion at any
              time.

              2. SUBJECT OF AGREEMENT The subject of this Agreement is the
              supply of fruit products submitted by Purchaser to The Fruit Box
              and the supply thereof by The Fruit Box and subsequent delivery of
              product to the Purchaser.

              3. Quotations & Orders (a) Unless otherwise specified, all written
              quotations shall be intended for reference purposes only,
              constituting neither an offer to sell nor imposing any obligations
              or liability on The Fruit Box. All written quotations and offers
              to sell automatically expire ten (10) days from the date quoted
              unless otherwise specified. For greater certainty, all offers to
              sell are offers by The Fruit Box to sell to Purchaser on the terms
              set forth herein. (b) Unless otherwise expressly agreed upon in
              writing by The Fruit Box, any figures, measurements, dimensions,
              performance values, samples, patterns, statements, technical
              provisions or specifications, catalogues, brochures, depictions,
              photographs, images, models, designs, drawings, promotional
              materials in print or electronic format or other descriptive
              specifications relating to The Fruit Box's quotation or offer to
              sell ("Specifications") are approximations only and shall not be
              deemed to form part of any contract or be treated as constituting
              any representation, warranty or condition in relation to the goods
              or services. The Fruit Box reserves the right to modify these
              Specifications at any time prior to the execution of any Sales
              Agreement between Purchaser and The Fruit Box. (c) Any deviations
              between the goods supplied and any offers, samples, trial products
              and pre-deliveries are permitted in accordance with technical
              norms and within standard industry variances and tolerances. (d)
              No order placed by Purchaser shall be deemed to be accepted by The
              Fruit Box unless and until confirmed in writing by The Fruit Box
              or its duly authorized representative or until performed by The
              Fruit Box. The Fruit Box reserves the right to accept or decline
              any order in whole or in part within thirty (30) days after
              receipt of Purchaser's order, during which time the order may only
              be cancelled, rescheduled or modified by Purchaser with the prior
              written consent of The Fruit Box or its duly authorized
              representative. For greater certainty, subsequent requirements of
              Purchaser for goods not contained in an original offer to sell or
              Purchaser's order must be accepted and confirmed in writing by The
              Fruit Box or its duly authorized representative.

              4. Price, Terms of Payment and Financing (a) The price for all
              goods and services shall be expressly set out in the Sales
              Agreement, delivered in the form of an Order Form. (b) Unless
              otherwise stated in writing by The Fruit Box, the price of goods
              shall be exclusive of any retail sales tax. The price shall be
              exclusive of shipping charges, insurance, applicable sale, use or
              other taxes payable to any governmental authority ("Additional
              Costs"). (c) Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, The Fruit
              Box's invoices shall due for payment immediately and shipments
              shall only be made against advance payment. Unless otherwise
              agreed upon in writing by The Fruit Box, all payments shall be in
              Canadian Funds and must be made directly to The Fruit Box in
              accordance with the payment options described on The Fruit Box's
              Order Form. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, Purchaser
              shall not have any right of deduction or set-off. Objections to
              The Fruit Box's accounting, account statements, account
              reconciliations, etc. must be received in writing by The Fruit Box
              within a period of four (4) weeks from the date of the invoice or
              other applicable. In the event that Purchaser fails to provide a
              timely objection notice to The Fruit Box, the terms of the invoice
              or other document shall be deemed to have been irrevocably
              accepted by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Fruit
              Box reserves the right to correct, at any time, any invoicing
              errors, including calculation errors, which may arise from time to
              time.

              5. Delivery of Goods and Performance of Services (a) Unless
              otherwise agreed upon in writing, The Fruit Box shall deliver
              goods at any time after The Fruit Box has notified Purchaser that
              goods are ready for delivery by means of an order confirmation
              notice. Selection of the carrier and route of delivery shall be
              made by The Fruit Box. Delivery of goods to a common carrier or a
              registered courier shall constitute delivery to Purchaser and risk
              of loss shall thereupon pass to Purchaser. In no event shall The
              Fruit Box have any liability in connection with shipment, nor
              shall the carrier be deemed to be an agent of The Fruit Box.
              Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the
              shipment or receipt of goods is delayed for reasons beyond the
              responsibility of The Fruit Box, risk of loss shall pass to
              Purchaser upon receipt of an order confirmation notice or other
              similar document from The Fruit Box. (b) The Fruit Box will use
              commercially reasonable efforts to deliver goods in the shortest
              time possible. However, specific dates and times will not be
              guaranteed. (c) Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the
              parties, The Fruit Box reserves the right to deliver goods in
              installments and/or perform services in stages. Each delivery of
              goods shall be treated as a separate transaction and payment
              thereof shall be in proportion to the overall purchase price set
              out in the Sales Agreement. Delay or failure by The Fruit Box to
              deliver an installment and/or perform a stage of service in
              accordance with these Terms shall not entitle Purchaser to
              repudiate or cancel the delivery of other installments or stages
              of goods under the Sales Agreement. (d) Reminders and final
              deadlines must be communicated in writing. (e) The Fruit Box shall
              not be liable to Purchaser for any delay or failure to deliver
              goods and/or perform services including but not limited to any
              cause beyond The Fruit Box's reasonable control, including,
              without limitation, any Act of God, fire, casualty, flood,
              earthquake, war, strike, lockout, epidemic, illness or injury to
              workers, delayed or failed deliveries by subcontractors, power
              failure, damage or destruction of production facilities, riot,
              insurrection, transportation delays or defaults, delay in supply
              or shortages of fuel, components, raw materials or supplies,
              labour shortage, acts or omissions of third parties, action of any
              governmental authority, or any other cause beyond the reasonable
              control of The Fruit Box (the "Force Majeure"). In such event, The
              Fruit Box must promptly provide Purchaser with written notice of
              the Force Majeure. The Fruit Box's time for delivery and/or
              performance shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost
              by reasons of the Force Majeure without subjecting The Fruit Box
              to any liability or penalty. If the Force Majeure event lasts
              longer than forty-five (45) calendar days, The Fruit Box may
              immediately terminate all or part of the Sales Agreement, without
              incurring any liability or penalty, by providing written notice of
              such cancellation to Purchaser. (f) For greater certainty, The
              Fruit Box shall not be liable for any damages, losses, costs or
              expenses (collectively, the Damage") resulting from The Fruit
              Box’s delay in delivery of goods and/or provision of services to
              Purchaser unless such Damage arises from the gross negligence of
              The Fruit Box. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the gross
              negligence of The Fruit Box causes a delay in the delivery of the
              goods or provision of services, Purchaser's sole remedy shall be
              the payment of compensation equal to half of a percent (0.5%) per
              week up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the value of the
              portion of the delivery which cannot be used on time for its
              intended purpose as a result of the delay.

              6. Inspection and Acceptance of Goods and Services (a)
              Notwithstanding (i) payment, (ii) passage of title, or (iii) prior
              inspection or tests, all goods and services furnished under Sales
              Agreement shall be subject to Purchaser's right of inspection and
              acceptance upon delivery. (b) Following delivery and within three
              (3) calendar days of receipt of goods by Purchaser, Purchaser
              shall provide The Fruit Box with a written notice containing the
              full details of any alleged defect or non-conformity in goods
              ("Rejection Notice"). Purchaser may return rejected goods to The
              Fruit Box at Purchaser's risk and expense and in accordance with
              The Fruit Box's instructions. The Fruit Box shall make the final
              determination as to whether its goods are defective or
              non-conforming. Purchaser's exclusive remedy and The Fruit Box's
              entire liability to Purchaser in the event of a rejection shall be
              expressly limited to either the prompt replacement of the goods,
              the repair of any defect or non-conformity or, at The Fruit Box's
              option, the issuance of a credit or refund for the purchase price
              of the defective or non-conforming goods. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, in the event that Purchaser fails to provide a timely
              Rejection Notice to The Fruit Box, Purchaser will be deemed to
              have irrevocably accepted goods. Moreover, the use of any goods by
              Purchaser, its agents, employees or licensees, for any purpose
              after delivery thereof, shall constitute irrevocable acceptance of
              goods by Purchaser.

            <p className="text-left text-lg text-gray-600 pt-[30px]">
              7. Title Title to and ownership of all goods shall not pass to
              Purchaser until payment of the purchase price and any Additional
              Costs has been made in full to The Fruit Box.

              8. Security Interest and Solvency Purchaser represents and
              warrants to The Fruit Box that Purchaser is solvent. The Fruit Box
              retains a security interest in goods to secure payment of the
              purchase price and all other indebtedness and obligations that
              Purchaser now and in the future owes to The Fruit Box. Purchaser
              shall take all actions that The Fruit Box requests to perfect, and
              to obtain and maintain first priority of, that security interest,
              and Purchaser shall pay, or reimburse The Fruit Box for, all fees,
              taxes and other costs that are incurred in connection with those
              actions. To the extent permitted by law, Purchaser waives
              requirement of being provided with a copy of any financing or
              verification statement or renewal thereof.

              amended by Purchaser except with the approval in writing of The
              Fruit Box and on terms that Purchaser shall indemnify The Fruit
              Box in full and on demand against all loss (including loss of

              used, as well as accounting, legal and clerical costs), damages,

              10. Limited Warranty (a) Except as otherwise specified herein, The
              Fruit Box warrants that: (i) all goods and services purchased
              hereunder are free from defects in material and workmanship and
              conform to the requirements of Sales Agreement; (ii) The Fruit Box
              has good title to goods and the right to sell them to Purchaser;
              and (iii) goods and services shall conform to the written
              Specifications, if any, described in the Sales Agreement. (b)
              Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, the warranty period for
              all goods delivered by The Fruit Box will expire three (3)
              calendar days after the date of the delivery of goods to the
              Purchaser (the "Warranty Period"). If Purchaser believes that the
              goods and/or services are defective or deficient, Purchaser shall
              provide The Fruit Box with a written notice by letter, fax or
              e-mail, containing the full details of the alleged defect or
              deficiency and setting out the date of the order confirmation, the
              delivery confirmation or the invoice (the "Rejection Notice"). At
              The Fruit Box's direction, Purchaser shall return the defective or
              deficient goods to The Fruit Box at Purchaser's risk and expense
              and in accordance with The Fruit Box's return policy in effect
              from time to time, failing which any and all warranty obligation
              on The Fruit Box's part shall become void. The Fruit Box shall
              promptly investigate such claimed breach and shall, at its sole
              discretion and within thirty (30) days of the date of the
              Rejection Notice either: (i) provide information to Purchaser
              confirming that no breach of warranty has in fact occurred; or
              (ii) advise Purchaser of The Fruit Box's planned corrective
              action. If The Fruit Box determines that the Rejection Notice was
              given without cause, Purchaser shall reimburse The Fruit Box for
              all applicable costs and expenses thereby occasioned to The Fruit
              Box. If a breach of warranty has in fact occurred, The Fruit Box
              shall, at its sole discretion, promptly: (i) repair or replace the
              defective goods at no additional cost to Purchaser; (ii) issue
              credit or refund amounts paid by Purchaser related to the portion
              of goods and/or services in breach of warranty; or (iii) unless
              the defect in question is a minor one, cancel the Sales Agreement.
              All costs incidental to repairing or replacing defective goods or
              correcting or re-performing the deficient services shall be borne
              by Purchaser and in no event shall The Fruit Box be liable for
              such costs. All warranty repairs or replacements and any services
              that have been re-performed or corrected under warranty shall only
              be warranted for the balance of the original Warranty Period. (c)
              Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, where
              The Fruit Box is required to perform corrective work, The Fruit
              Box's warranty shall be limited to the goods actually delivered.
              The Fruit Box shall only warrant the proper functionality of its
              products and components where the faulty functioning in question
              cannot be attributed to incorrect or incomplete information
              provided by Purchaser. (d) Purchaser shall not be entitled to
              withhold payments on account of warranty claims or other
              counter-claims not recognized by The Fruit Box. (e) Warranty
              Exclusions: This warranty excludes normal wear and tear and
              ordinary deviations in size, weight or quality. This warranty also
              excludes coverage for used goods and seconds as well as goods not
              manufactured by The Fruit Box or its affiliates. Repair or
              replacement of goods and/or re-performance or correction of
              services due to: (i) misuse or abuse; (ii) improper use or
              maintenance; (iii) failure to observe instructions contained in
              user/owner manuals; (iv) mishandling or testing by Purchaser, its
              affiliates and agents; (v) negligence; (vi) alterations,
              maintenance or repair work undertaken by Purchaser or third
              parties; (vii) excessive stress; (viii) accident; (ix) improper
              storage; (x) use of incompatible supplies or cleaning agents; (xi)
              an event of Force Majeure; (xii) chemical influences; (xiii)
              foreign object damage; or (xiv) damage in transit, are excluded
              from The Fruit Box's warranty obligations. (f) The preceding
              paragraphs set forth the exclusive remedy for all claims based on
              failure of, or defect in, goods sold hereunder, whether the
              failure or defect arises before or during the warranty period, and
              whether a claim, however instituted, is based on contract,
              indemnity, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability
              or otherwise. Upon the expiration of the warranty period, all such
              liability shall terminate. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by
              The Fruit Box, this warranty shall not be assigned to any third
              party. THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL
              OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. NO
              IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR
              PURPOSE SHALL APPLY. THE FRUIT BOX DOES NOT WARRANT ANY GOODS OR
              SERVICES OF OTHERS, WHICH PURCHASER HAS DESIGNATED.
